If you would like to learn why iDavi is **THE Instant Commission** marketplace read the about iDavi section.  You will learn how we promote for you.

Here is some more on the features in this incredible plugin:

# Automatic Blog Posting

You setup what product categories on iDavi and optionally, keywords you want to search for and the plugin will automatically create new posts in your blogs to promote the products that are found.  You can setup as manay category and/or keywords as you want and define the posting schedule.  

When setup the plugin can drip in content to your blog as fast or slow as you want.

# Auto Comments

One of the signs of an active blog is when people are commenting on the posts in the blog.  The iDavi plugin can automatically place comments on the posts that it creates for each product.

The great thing about this feature is that each comment is 100% relevant because the comment comes from the comments and ratings at iDavi for this exact product.

# Banner Ads

No suprise here.  iDavi like so many other banner ad plugins can place a banner above and/or below each post.  However, what the others cannot do is pull an **instant commission** product from *iDavi* and throw on your affiliate ID.

# Hop Ads

Have a little space in tht side bar?  Put an iDavi Hop Ad widget there and promote some **instant commission** products that put cash directly to your Paypal account **Instantly**.

No room there for more ads?  How much are you really making with those Adsense ads?

# Email Ads

Most people do not realize how many emails are sent from your Wordpress blog.  Anytime someone signs up, forgets a password, make a comment they get an email.  The *iDavi* plugin will monetize those emails by automatically adding ads into those emails.

# Front Page Category Exclusion

If your blog has a big following then you probably do not want it to suddenly look like your have turned into a big promotion center.  With the front page category exclusion feature you can post products into specific categorie(s) and exclude them from show on the front page of your blog.  So you can quietly promote them wihout a big front page splash.

There is no cost to be an affiliate at iDavi or to make money at iDavi.  There are additional upgrade options once you are in iDavi but they do not prevent you from promoting products at iDavi and making commissions.

Here is a [link to a post](http://info.idavi.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37&Itemid=124) on our information site that explains everything.

= Does this work with other sites or feeds? =

No this addon is written to work with just iDavi.  It has been adapted to read the advanced feeds from iDavi that include images, ratings, comments and much more.  Howver, this plugin is based on the MoneyFeed plugin for wordpress.  If you have other feeds you can use that plugin to do similar things.  But we recommend that you give iDavi a try, you will not find a better product feed anywhere else.

== A little about iDavi ==

iDavi is a digital marketplace that aggregates and lists products from merchants that use the popular RAP instant commission sales software.

We stand out from other "marketplaces" who just list the products in an "affiliate center" - for a number of reasons.  Here are just a few:

* We are affiliate marketers ourselves and understand that affiliates do not want to send their customers to a "marketplace" that was designed for affiliates to find and promote products.  In iDavi, we separate the buyer's area from the affiliate / merchant areas. This allows us to provide what each group of users need, making for easier sales for the customer and a faster and more productive experience for the affiliates and merchants.
* iDavi is Intelligent.  We track the buying habits of repeat customers at iDavi, and present them with logical suggestions of other products and services.  This increases the likelihood that the customer will find another product that they are interested in, and removes the distraction of unrelated products that will remove them from the buying position.
* iDavi is the central hub between our Merchants and Affiliates.  Tying it all together means we can provide a centralized area for merchants and affiliate to manage their marketing efforts.  In the Affiliate / Merchant area we provide a full range of statistics, charts, graphs, alerts and affiliate tools.
* iDavi was designed with the customer in mind.  Not only have we created a dynamic customer centered experience in the marketplace, we have also created a central hub for the customer.  In the Customer Account area, they can see all of their purchases, even those purchases made before iDavi was released.  Customers can see their transaction details, product details, re-download the product, contact the merchant, rate the product and even promote the product via multiple social networks.  An iDavi customer will really feel "cared for".

**More reasons we stand out for Affiliates:**

* We have created a unique single signup for Affiliates.  Unlike other marketplaces where you have to signup with every merchant to be an affiliate, iDavi will sign you up for a merchant automatically, the first time any of your customers views a vendor's sales page.  This alone can save many hours of time and tracking.  And, you are a full affiliate, not just a one time hit.  Future sales by that customer at that vendor are yours.
* iDavi performs cross promotion in many ways all through our automated processes.  This provides even more opportunity for the affiliate to make more commission.  No other marketplace helps you make backend sales.
* Because iDavi was designed by Marketers, we have designed iDavi to help our Affiliates and Merchants get the best return for the traffic that is sent to us.  Here are just a few of the ways in which an affiliate can earn instant commissions:
* Send direct traffic to any page on iDavi (Front Page, Category List, Product Details, etc) and the visitor is cookied for you.  Any products purchased through iDavi are translated into commissions for you.
* Backend cross promotions which could be Emails, similar products lists, etc.
* Use any of our automated affiliate tools.  We have the following tools available now:  Wordpress plugin, RSS, XML and JSON product feeds that work with other tools, iDavi Markup Language for Badges, Product Lists and more on any web page.
* Built in Social Networking Integration, so that when a customer likes, tweets or comments on any of the products in iDavi, the affiliate's id goes along as a part of the link.  That means that now, your customers are also going to be promoting for you.

**More reasons we stand out for Merchants:**

* Our merchants are using RAP as their Sales and Affiliate management system.  We have provided a FREE, no charge addon that installs in a couple of minutes, and automatically uploads your products and the details around your products.  After installation, everything is "automagically" kept up to date in real-time with the iDavi system.
* We provide a powerful administrative area to manage all aspects of your marketing business.  More information about all of your sites and products in one location.  You will have more information than you have ever had before.
* As affiliates promote your product(s) they automatically get added to YOUR affiliate database, on the domain that you  are selling your product.  You can then email them directly with affiliate promotions, etc. - directly from your RAP admin panel.  By having the affiliate in your system, you have options that you do not have on other marketplaces, where they provide you either no affiliate details, or just pass the email address where the payment goes.
* We provide many cross promotion opportunities for you.  Many merchants do not take the time to list all of their products in one place or even add them to download pages.  We cross promote your additional products throughout iDavi, to both potential and existing buyers of your products.
* Merchants have the ability to setup a special "Discount" for iDavi.  The amount and duration of this discount is completely up to the merchant.  This discount is only available on the iDavi site.  Products with a special price discount will have the original price crossed out and the new price highlighted, right on the product details page.
* Any product that has a "Discount" active in iDavi, is eligible for the "Deal of the Day".  iDavi staff select products for "Deal of the Day" from those products that the merchant has identified as having an iDavi exclusive discount.  This is a great opportunity for a merchant to have a product highlighted for a day.  iDavi also does extra promotion for Deal of the Day products.
* Some times there is more than one partner in a product, called an Equity Partner.  iDavi has been designed to support your Equity Partners, as well.  Equity Partners can create an iDavi account and get statistics on products that they are an Equity Partner for, without seeing the entire site owner's details.  This helps to protect the information that partners share.
* Lets not forget the Social Networking integration that is built into iDavi.  Customers can share links to your products with their friends on the Social networks.

It does not matter if you are an Instant Commission affiliate, a [RAP](http://idavi.com/?productid=3285&a=idavi) merchant, an Equity Partner, or all 3, the one single interface for Affiliates / Merchants will have it all in one easy to use location.  You will get a complete view of your entire business.

We hope that we have made you as excited about iDavi as we are.
